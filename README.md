# Typing Analyzer

An application designed to listen to global keypresses and analyze various statistics about the user's typing behavior.

## Features

#### Analyze Typing Speed in Various Contexts
Do you type more quickly when writing code? When searching the web? This application can analyze typing speed and account for the currently-active process to determine when your typing is at its fastest.

#### Determine Most Commonly-Typed Letters and Words
Ever been curious what letters and words you type the most? Easily visualize these statistics with easy-to-digest graphs and charts.

#### Easily Adjusted Privacy Settings
Pause the application if doing sensitive typing, or turn off all saving and logging of words and keypresses to be left with a perfectly secure (but still interesting) analysis of typing patterns.
